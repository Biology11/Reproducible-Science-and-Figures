This repository is designated to contain the files for the assignment 'Reproducible Science and Figures.' It consists of one .Rmd file. Within the file, I first explore the features which make figures difficult to reproduce and understand. Second, I investigate the differences in male and female flipper lengths in the Adelie penguin, which could then be placed within the broader context of understanding sex differences in foraging. Finally, I share my code with another scientist to learn how I could improve it, to make it more easily understood and reproducible.
